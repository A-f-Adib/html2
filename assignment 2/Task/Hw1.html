     <h1>The cow</h1>
     <p>Cows are herbivorous animals that feed on grasses and plants. Their bodies are large, because of which they have enormous weights. To support this weight, cows’ legs have hooves that have been made secure due to keratin in them. This allows them to walk correctly. We need cows for many purposes like food, clothes, and cosmetics. In food, cows provide us with milk, cheese, butter, and meat. They are terrestrial mammals and give birth to young ones known as calves. Cows are diurnal animals and usually sleep at night. They have a great metabolism and require a lot of nutrition per day. </p>
